# 🍽️ Cuisine Classification using Machine Learning

A machine learning project to classify restaurants based on their cuisines using the Random Forest Classifier. This project was done as part of a task from **Cognifyz Technologies**.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

The objective is to develop a classification model that predicts the cuisine type of a restaurant given various features like location, type, and more.

## 📁 Dataset Structure[https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cuisine-classification-challenge/data]

- `train_features.csv`: Restaurant features (e.g., location, restaurant type, etc.)
- `train_labels.csv`: Corresponding cuisine labels
- `test_features.csv`: Features for prediction

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Random Forest Classifier
- Label Encoding & One-Hot Encoding
- RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

## 🧪 Model Evaluation

- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Classification report
- Cross-validation (RandomizedSearchCV)

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Data preprocessing and handling missing values
- Merging and encoding categorical features
- Model training and hyperparameter optimization
- Interpreting model performance using classification metrics

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Try XGBoost or LightGBM for improved performance
- Deploy as a Streamlit web app for real-time predictions
- Add more feature engineering for better accuracy

## 📄 Output

- A `.csv` file (`submission.csv`) containing predicted cuisines for the test data.
